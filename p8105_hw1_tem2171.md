## Short description of early_january_weather dataset

the variables in this dataset: origin (EWR), year (2013), month
(1/january), day(1-15), hour(1-23), temp(F), dewp(F), humid(%),
wind_dir(angle), wind_speed(mph), wind_gust (mph), precip (in), pressure
(mmhg), visib (mi), time_hour(date and hour)

the size of the dataset: rows: 358 columns:15

the mean temperature: 39.58

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes (x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

\#description of patterns that are apparent in this plot

As days increase, the average temperature per day increases, as do the
daily low and high temperatures. On days with high humidity, the high
and low temperatures are closer together than on days with relatively
low humidity.

## Problem 2

``` r
# random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
random_sample <- rnorm(10)

# logical vector indicating whether elements are greater than 0
vec_logical <- random_sample > 0

# character vector of length 10
vec_char <- c("My", "Name", "Is", "Teresa", "Moore", "And", "I", "Am", "Learning", "R")

# factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor levels
vec_factor <- factor(sample(c("Freshman", "Sophomore", "Junior"), 10, replace = TRUE))

# data frame comprised of random_sample, vec_logical, vec_char, vec_factor
problem2_df <- data.frame(random_sample, vec_logical, vec_char, vec_factor)

#find the means
mean_random_sample <- mean(random_sample)

mean_vec_logical <- mean(vec_logical)

numeric_vec_factor <- as.numeric(vec_factor)
mean_vec_factor <- mean(numeric_vec_factor)
```

# means:

random sample: -0.225 vec_logical:0.5 vec_char: argument is not numeric
or logical: returning NA vec_factor:argument is not numeric or logical:
returning NA

numeric_vec_factor: 2.3 numeric_vec_char: NA (character vectors do not
have an inherent order like factor vectors, so using as.numeric does not
work to find the mean)
